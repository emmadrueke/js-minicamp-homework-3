# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		

* Objects: 
	A phone is an object in real life, and it has properties like color, size, and type. An object is also the same thing. This code gives a simple value to an object, and with in curly braces you can add more details like what color is the object?
		
* Properties:
	Furthering my example from Objects, a property is the color of your phone. A property has a key and a value. The key in this example would be color, and the the value would be what ever color your phone is. 

* Methods:
	Objects can also have methods. With the phone example a method for the phone could be turning on. A function could be written within the object that would turn the phone on. A method that we use frequently is ‘console.log()’. There is an object called console, and a method attached to it called log. Calling this method allows us to print what ever is in the parentheses. 

* for in loop:
	Allows the developer to iterate over properties in an object that have values. It’s similar to the ‘for’ loop practiced in lesson two, but specific for objects. 

* Dot notation vs bracket notation:
	



2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
